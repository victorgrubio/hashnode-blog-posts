## Why Writing Helps You Learn

Many of you may have tried to start technical writing and left it after a week.

Maybe someone has created a blog but stopped posting after a year or so. 

You could have thought: "Why would I spent time writing for free if I don't like it so much. I should see another YT tutorial about this random topic"

Maybe you have wondered: "Would I be the one that replies in StackOverflow one day?"

Some of you may feel identified by these sentences. I will try to explain to you my main motivation to start writing:


> ## Writing makes me learn better!

# Traditional learning methods SUCK!

As someone that comes from college here in Spain, I had to learn tons of things in a small amount of time. When the tests came, I could find myself with 8 exams in 4 days. This is Telecommunications Engineering we are talking about. Not an easy thing.

What would I do? What I have been educated for:  Try to learn how to do some exercises from previous years. Memorize the parts that are always asked the same way.

> It worked for 4 years!

When I arrived at my Machine Learning master's, I had to change. The math was the most complex I have seen in my life. Thanks to an awesome set of teachers, I STARTED to focus on understanding things in depth.  The knowledge I have acquired during that year is one of the most durable I can account for.

### Here is when everything started to make sense.

# Overcome the "Tutorial Syndrome"

We are born in the Youtube era. We have seen an incredible amount of videos for many topics to find a solution. A lot of content creators, almost infinite knowledge at hand ... But let me ask you a question:

> How much of this content did you remember after 3 days?

I will love to have some feedback in the comments. For me, almost nothing. Don't get me wrong. I love YT and it has brought amazing content to our lives for free.

But watching videos, reading books, posts ... IT'S ALL PASSIVE! 

It requires a lot less attention than coding, for example. In my experience, I could think of a couple of concepts extracted from books. I was amazed by the information. It released all the dopamine it could. 

Most of the time, every highlight in a book is forgotten. Lines of CODE and TEXT, created with BLOOD and SWEAT, usually aren't.

# Increase understanding of topics

> If you could name a topic that writing didn't help you to understand better, I am a living lie. 

Here I will use an example of my own experience. I was reading "Head First Design Patterns". Recommendable by the way. In this book, one or more [Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) are introduced and explained in each chapter. I was reading it almost every day, but after a week I thought: "Okay, I did not remember any pattern. I don't know how to apply them"

So I decided: "Let's code them in a different language". Book examples were in Java, so for me, the obvious pick was Python.

> IT TOOK ME 3 DAYS to make the [Abstract Factory](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/abstract_factory_pattern.htm) work! üòÖ

Don't have any doubt about this: I freaking know how to implement the abstract factory after that. And also learn how to model a pizza franchise business üòÜ

What I want you to see with this is: Learning things that perdure in your memory takes time! Probably, the complex things that you can do without checking a guide are built on multiple failed attempts and StackOverflow questions.

I will show you a graphic about the retention of information based on the channel it is acquired after 2 weeks.

# Learning one thing at a time

As software developers, we live in an industry that is constantly evolving. We are required to manage a lot of tools. This urges us to learn a lot of different things. For so much time we lose focus.

I love to learn new things. I love that sensation of reading a paragraph and say: "My god, this is great to know". Does Victor remember next month? Of course not.

I recommend everyone, including myself (the one that needs it the most): One thing at a time. Let's spend a week learning a small concept, let say: DTOs in Java. If we learn them for a week, write an article about it. You could visit it if you have any doubts! 

If you plan to learn something more complex, divide it and make it easier. A cloud certification for example. Let's say we plan to make it in 2 months. 

- Divide it into concepts by the guides of the provider and learn a service per week or so.
- Read articles 
- Make labs
- Write about the labs
- Repeat

When you make the sample tests, I am sure you will understand everything. 
> PD: Skin in the game. I will try to do this for my next cloud certs.


# Summary

Writing improves learning. This is **FEKTS**. The main points explain to defend this have been:

- ** Traditional methods for learning with memorization do not work **

- ** Complex concepts need deep understanding to be used **

- ** Writing requires explaining. Explaining requires understanding. **

- ** Passive learning (Reading, Watching) vs Active learning (Coding, Writing) **

- ** Try to code the tutorial in a different programming language. Or model the same problem differently for the same one **

- ** An article can be revisited. A thought can't **

- ** Learning one thing at a time **

I am HONOURED if you have reached this point. Thanks a lot for reading üíô

Hopefully, I was able to illustrate how technical writing is important for learning as developers.
